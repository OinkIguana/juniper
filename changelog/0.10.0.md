# [0.10.0] 2018-09-13

## Changes

- Changed serialization of `NaiveDate` when using the optional `chronos` support.

  **Note:** while this is not a Rust breaking change, if you relied on the serialization format (perhaps by storing serialized data in a database or making asumptions in your client code written in another language) it could be a breaking change for your application.

  [#151](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/151)

- The `GraphQLObject`, `GraphQLInputObject`, and `GraphQLEnum` custom derives will reject
  invalid [names](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/#Name) at compile time.

  [#170](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/170)

- Large integers (> signed 32bit) are now deserialized as floats. Previously,
  they produced an "integer out of range" error. For languages that do not
  have a distinction between integer and floating point types (such as
  javascript), this meant large whole floating point values could not be
  decoded (because they were represented without a fractional value such as `.0`).

  [#179](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/179)

- The `GraphQLObject`, `GraphQLInputObject`, and `GraphQLEnum` custom derives
  now parse doc strings and use them as descriptions. This behavior can be
  overridden by using an explicit GraphQL `description` annotation such as
  `#[graphql(description = "my description")]`. [View documentation](https://graphql-rust.github.io/types/objects/defining_objects.html#defining-objects).

  [#194](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/194)

- Introduced `IntoFieldError` trait to allow custom error handling
  i.e. custom result type. The error type must implement this trait resolving
  the errors into `FieldError`. [View documentation](https://graphql-rust.github.io/types/objects/error_handling.html#structured-errors).

  [#40](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/40)

- `GraphQLType` and `ToInputValue` are now implemented for Arc<T>

  [#212](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/212)

- Error responses no longer have a _data_ field, instead, error details are stored in the _extensions_ field

  **Note:** while this is a breaking change, it is a necessary one to better align with the latest [GraphQL June 2018](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/June2018/#sec-Errors) specification, which defines the reserved _extensions_ field for error details. [View documentation](https://graphql-rust.github.io/types/objects/error_handling.html#structured-errors).

  [#219](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/pull/219)

* The `GraphQLObject` and `GraphQLInputObject` custom derives
  now support lifetime annotations.

  [#225](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/225)

* When using the `GraphQLObject` custom derive, fields can now be omitted by annotating the field with `#[graphql(skip)]`. [View documentation](https://graphql-rust.github.io/types/objects/defining_objects.html#skipping-fields).

  [#220](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper/issues/220)

* Due to newer dependencies, the oldest Rust version supported is now 1.22.0
